#FuzConvSteganalysis: Fuzzy logic and convolutional neural network for locative steganalysis in digital images

FuzConvSteganalysis is an innovative software that uses a combination of fuzzy logic and convolutional neural networks to detect hidden information in digital images. It focuses on locative steganalysis, identifying the exact location of concealed data in images. FuzConvSteganalysis employs advanced machine learning techniques, providing a robust tool to uncover covert information hidden in digital images. This software has the potential to prevent the misuse of digital images for data theft and covert communication, enhancing digital security.

#Steps to execute the codes:
1)	For data embedding, you need to have MatLab, and execute WOWupdate.m (make sure you use a correct folder for input images) and My_WOW_main_function.m is in a same folder.
2)	To run the CNN, you need to have Python with MatplotLib, TensorFlow, Numpy, and OpenCV2 libraries and execute FuzConvTrue.ipynb
3)	Make sure you have the right folders as given in the codes for inputs and results recording. 
Thank you for your considering our code and giving suggestions on how to make them more user friendly!
